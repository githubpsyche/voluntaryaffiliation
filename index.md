# Abstract

This study examines how homophily -- the tendency for individuals to form ties with similar others -- affects team formation under different task contexts.
Homophily is traditionally understood as an overarching principle of social network formation, but a growing body of observational research suggests that it is inconsistently expressed depending on task demands and participant factors.
To clarify these findings, we implemented a novel experiment where participants chose teammates from a diverse pool for tasks with varied stakes and objectives.
Preliminary findings indicate that homophily may decrease under high-stakes, adversarial scenarios, and that participant competitiveness and background ~~~~-- including age, gender, and race -- moderate team composition.
We further implemented and compared competing accounts of team formation as computational models, exploring how well homophily and other associative processes capture the observed team formation patterns.
Our results suggest that homophily is not a universal principle of team formation, but rather a flexible strategy that individuals variably deploy in response to task demands.
