Birds of a feather compete together? Modeling homophily in team formation across stakes and backgrounds

This study examines how homophily -- the tendency for individuals to form ties with similar others -- affects team formation under different task contexts.
Homophily is traditionally understood as an overarching principle of social network formation (McPherson et al, 2001), but a growing body of observational research suggests that it is inconsistently expressed depending on task demands and participant factors (e.g., these et al, 2001; those et al, 2001).
To clarify these findings, we implemented a novel experiment where participants chose teammates from a diverse pool for tasks with varied stakes and objectives.
Results showed homophily decreased when compensation was believed to be performance-based, and that participant background and competitiveness influenced team composition.
Implementing and comparing competing accounts of team formation as computational models, we found that a model that combined homophily with unipolar demographic preferences best captured the observed team formation patterns.
Our results suggest that homophily is not a universal principle of team formation, but rather a flexible strategy that individuals variably deploy in response to task demands.

This study examines how homophily -- the tendency for individuals to form ties with similar others -- affects team formation under different task contexts.
Homophily is traditionally understood as an overarching principle of social network formation, but a growing body of observational research suggests that it is inconsistently expressed depending on task demands and participant factors.
To clarify these findings, we implemented a novel experiment where participants chose teammates from a diverse pool for tasks with varied stakes and objectives.
Results showed homophily decreased when the task scenario was described as high stakes and adversarial, and that participant background and competitiveness influenced team composition.
Implementing and formally comparing competing accounts of team formation as computational models, we found that a model that combined homophily with unipolar demographic preferences best captured the observed team formation patterns.

We implemented and formally compared competing accounts of team formation as computational models, exploring how homophily and other associative processes best captured the observed team formation patterns.

Our results suggest that homophily is not a universal principle of team formation, but rather a flexible strategy that individuals variably deploy in response to task demands.

Our initial results suggest that homophily is not a universal principle of team formation, but rather a flexible strategy that individuals adaptively deploy in response to varying task demands.


In our experiment, participants chose teammates from a diverse pool for tasks characterized by different stakes and objectives. 
Findings suggest that homophily may decrease under high-stakes, adversarial scenarios, with participant background and competitiveness also playing roles in team composition. 
Our approach includes implementing and comparing computational models to explore how combinations of homophily and unipolar demographic preferences might explain team formation patterns. 
The results hint that homophily is not a universal principle of team formation but rather a flexible strategy that individuals adaptively deploy in response to varying task demands.

Homophily is traditionally understood as an overarching principle of social network formation, but a growing body of observational research suggests that it is inconsistently expressed depending on task demands and participant factors.
To clarify these findings, we implemented a novel experiment where participants chose teammates from a diverse pool for tasks with varied stakes and objectives.
Preliminary findings suggest that homophily may decrease under high-stakes, adversarial scenarios, and that participant competitiveness and background -- including age, gender, and race -- moderate team composition.
We further implemented and compared competing accounts of team formation as computational models, exploring how well homophily and other associative processes capture the observed team formation patterns.
Our results hint that homophily is not a universal principle of team formation, but rather a flexible strategy that individuals variably deploy in response to task demands.
