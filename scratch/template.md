# Abstract
To investigate X, this study examines Y.
Description of task.
Description of manipulation. 
Description of core analysis innovation.
Most important result.
Other important results.
Implications for theory.

# Introduction

First paragraph:
Start with question.
Review most basic background around the question.
Identify the gap in the literature that the study will address.

Second paragraph:
Identify the framework that will be used to address the question.
Give some context about the framework:
What it is
How it has been used in the past
Why it is relevant to the current question

Third paragraph:
Summary of research relating framework to the question.
What has been done in the past?
What are the limitations of past research?
How does the current study address these limitations?

Fourth paragraph:
Describe the (proposed) experiment.
What's the basic structure?
What are the key manipulations?
What are the key dependent measures?
How does the design relate to the research question?

Fifth paragraph:
Describe the (proposed) analyses.
What are the key analyses?
What are the key predictions?
How will the results inform the research question?

# Theoretical Background

More granular background on the framework -- enough detail that one could reason about how the framework would address the different phenomena discussed in the paper before being told explicitly.

Also a good place for historical context about the framework, its standing, alternative frameworks, etc.

I don't have a good template for opening of this section yet.
Particularly challenging when I want to avoid redundancy with other chapters.
Key is to refer back to what has already been said, and then jump off to introduce anything new I want to introduce.
Could maybe write other sections before this to figure out what I want to introduce here.

## Subsections

Define subsections based on each experimental variable that is important to the study.
If it's important enough to have a subsection, usually a diagram is worth including.

Then for each subsection:
First paragraph identifies/defines the variable and effectively lists the empirical phenomena that are relevant to the variable.
Subsequent paragraphs discuss each phenonemon in turn. 
First, describing the phenomenon in detail.
Second, relating the phenomenon to our theoretical framework described in opening.
Then moving on to the next phenomenon.

## Motivation for New Experiment

This is where I connect the dots from my theoretical background to the new experiment.
My entire case for approaching the research question the way I am goes here.
Only the actual details of the experiment are left for the methods section. 

A diagram can go here to provide an overview of the experiment and how it explores the theoretical issues.

Initial sentence(s) should make the key observation that motivates the experiment -- describing an opportunity to test the theory.
Second sentence(s) can elaborate on the observation.
Third sentence(s) should be clear what the experiment will do to address the observation.
Fourth sentence(s) should similarly be clear about how analyses will address the observation.
Final sentence ends paragraph with integrative statement about how the research will address the research question and improve theory.

My repetition proposal chapter has a paragraph about preliminary analyses. Seems optional, but is only place such content can go -- after introduction of core analyses, but before fuller description of research aims and hypotheses that preliminary results would inform.

Next set of paragraphs should describe research aims and hypotheses.

Examples from repetition proposal:

"The central manipulation of the proposed experiment is..."
"The proposed research addresses the limitations of..."
"Proposed modeling will focus on adjudicating between three broad hypotheses about..."

This could use some workshopping but is roughly the structure.

# Experimental Details / Proposed Experiment

Just one opening paragraph.
More concrete, nuts-and-bolts explanation of the experimental manipulation, but not as concrete as full methods section.
End with a sentence like: "This manipulation will allow us..."

## Methods
Very detailed. Exactly how many participants, how many trials, etc.

## Archival Data
"The proposed experiment will be conducted in conjunction with analyses of two archival datasets that have been previously collected and analyzed."

Then a subsection for each dataset.

## Proposed Analyses

Opening paragraph contains information shared across all analyses and restates research aims they all help address.

Then a subsection for each analysis or key details. Be pretty liberal with subheadings here.

(Would we do this in a normal paper? Maybe not. But it's a good way to organize the content.)

## Proposed Model Evaluation
In general, outline how I will evaluate the model in the context of the experiment. 

Usually a review of likelihood-based fitting and comparison, simulation of key effects, and possibly some other analyses (e.g., generalization criterion).

In other chapters, can refer back to this chapter for full details, with some commentary on how the model evaluation will be adapted to the specific experiment.

# Expected Outcomes and Preliminary Analyses

Opening paragraphs ideally say something new about how experiment will inform theory that could not have been said before presenting all the details of the experiment.

Later paragraphs in opening should outline the structure of subsections and the content of each.  

## Replication of Previous Findings / Preliminary Analyses

Usually we'll start by saying what we expect to reproduce from previous work (and maybe what we don't).
In context of a proposal, this is a good opportunity to present any preliminary analyses that have been conducted on archival data.
In a normal paper, this provides a "baseline" or "lay of the land" for the reader to understand the new results in context.

"Previous analyses of the @lohnas2014retrieved and @kahana2005spacing archival datasets substantially inform expectations and provide motivating questions for the proposed experiment."

## Primary Analyses / Main Results / "Manipulation of ..."

This is where we present the main results of the experiment focused on our key manipulation(s).

Quickly refer back to original specification of analysis. 
Start by reviewing the key predictions and hypotheses.
Then present the results.
Then discuss the results in the context of the predictions and hypotheses.
These should motivate the next set of analyses.

## Model Evaluation
Since I will be simulating all analyses that I also run on the data, I can present model comparison results early, and then in data sections, present the data results and model fits together.
In an experimental paper, is perhaps right to do this right after the main results, so that they are in focus when discussing the results.
Competing models are competing accounts of the main results, so it makes sense to present them together.

## Secondary Analyses / "Exploration of ..."

Same deal as primary analyses, but for secondary analyses.
We've already presented the analysis plan in the methods section, so this is just the results and discussion.
We review the key predictions and hypotheses for these analyses, this time placing them in the context of the primary analyses.
Then we present the results. 
Then we discuss them in the context of the predictions and hypotheses.

And so on for any other analyses.
Keep going until all relevant hypotheses have been substantially evaluated.
If I don't hit that point, I should address gaps in other sections or scale back the scope of the paper.

# Discussion / Conclusions

I usually overdo this, rewriting the same points over and over.
Let's keep this short and sweet at first, adding detail as needed.

Rather than as a restatement of the introduction, I can think of this as an opportunity to talk about the implications of the results for the theory. Usually not needed at proposal stage since we already talk about prospective results in detail elsewhere.

Subsections organize based on topic. Examples from influential modeling paper (Polyn, Norman & Kahana, 2009):
"Clustering: Association vs Disruption"
"Task context and human memory"
"Developing the CMR model of encoding dynamics"
"Relationship to other models of free recall"
"The control of memory search: Future directions"
