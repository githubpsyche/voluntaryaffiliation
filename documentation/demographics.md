APA Inclusive Language Guidelines (https://www.apa.org/about/apa/equity-diversity-inclusion/language-guidelines)

For Asian Pacific Islander, guidlines suggest that Asians are people with ancestry in Asia and Pacific Islanders are an Indigenous population -- need to split these two up. Also, we should consider separating Desi people from East Asians, as physical differences between these groups are important in self-identification

For African-American, APA Guidelines suggest that we change to Black to designate a racial category

For Latinx, APA guidelines suggest that the -x suffix is atypical in Hispanic langauges and Latine may be preferred. Consider using Hispanic/Latine/Latinx

For Indigenous, we should consider that the category is incredibly broad and encompasses individuals with a wide degree of physical dissimilarity.
